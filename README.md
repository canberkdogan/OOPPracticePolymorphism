# Practice Polymorphism
This project demonstrates the use of polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) with C#. It includes a base class GeometricShape and derived classes Square, Rectangle, and Triangle, each implementing their own method to calculate and display their areas.

Project Overview
The project consists of the following classes:

GeometricShape: A base class for all geometric shapes. It provides properties for Width and Height, and methods for calculating and displaying the area.
Square: Inherits from GeometricShape. Overrides the AreaCalc method to calculate the area of a square.
Rectangle: Inherits from GeometricShape. Overrides the AreaCalc method to calculate the area of a rectangle using the base class method.
Triangle: Inherits from GeometricShape. Overrides the AreaCalc method to calculate the area of a triangle.
